# A sokol ImGui + ImPlot example in Zig

Made with Zig 0.14.0-dev.2623+7aa95bc7f. Should work with a few versions either side of that quite alright.

```bash
zig build run
```

## WASM

View it live [here](https://fjebaker.github.io/zig-sokol-imgui-wasm/).

Build it yourself with:

```bash
zig build run -Dtarget=wasm32-emscripten
```
